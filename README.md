### Issues and Resolutions
With three people working on this project we had to figure out how to all work in our own branches without creating errors when merging materials. While we decided to all work in our own branch we still faced some issues with not having the correct amounts of commits or not using the correct commands in Github.  Needless to say we all could use some extra Github experience under our belts.

Deployment using Surge was painless and Heroku should take note. We had one member what had to delete his project and pull fresh material down as we could not get Github corrected.

### Additional Comments
We all discussed a style to keep our code consistent while creating seperate CSS files to target our own pages, etc.
